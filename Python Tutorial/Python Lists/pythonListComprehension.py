# List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
# Example:
# Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.
# Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []
