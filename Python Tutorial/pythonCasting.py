# There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable.
# This can be done with casting.
# Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

# Int Example
x = int(1)
x = int(2.8)
x = int("3")

# Float Example
x = float(1)
x = float(2.8)
x = float("3")
x = float("4.2")

# String Example
x = str("s1")
x = str(2)
x = str(3.0)
